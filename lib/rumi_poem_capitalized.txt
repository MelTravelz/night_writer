A MOMENT OF HAPPINESS
BY RUMI

A MOMENT OF HAPPINESS,
YOU AND I SITTING ON THE VERANDAH,
APPARENTLY TWO, BUT ONE IN SOUL, YOU AND I.
WE FEEL THE FLOWING WATER OF LIFE HERE,
YOU AND I, WITH THE GARDEN'S BEAUTY
AND THE BIRDS SINGING.
THE STARS WILL BE WATCHING US,
AND WE WILL SHOW THEM
WHAT IT IS TO BE A THIN CRESCENT MOON.
YOU AND I UNSELFED, WILL BE TOGETHER,
INDIFFERENT TO IDLE SPECULATION, YOU AND I.
THE PARROTS OF HEAVEN WILL BE CRACKING SUGAR
AS WE LAUGH TOGETHER, YOU AND I.
IN ONE FORM UPON THIS EARTH,
AND IN ANOTHER FORM IN A TIMELESS SWEET LAND.
